        <h2>Technology Fee</h2>
        <p>
          The Student Technology Fee is a $38 per quarter fee paid by all matriculated students of the University of Washington. The committee appropriates roughly $5 million in student funding across almost one hundred proposals annually. All projects funded by the STF are not-for-profit and for student use.
        </p>
        <h2>Proposal Process</h2>
        <p>
          Funding is allocated via a proposal/grant cycle run by the committee. At the beginning of the year, a Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued. Proposal submissions are accepted at the beginning of each quarter, and authors are asked to present the request at a weekly board meeting. At the end of each quarter, the committee votes and issues funding decisions. Those who receive awards must spend and report expenditures by the end of the academic year.
        </p>
        <h2>Student Outreach</h2>
        <p>
          All STF projects involve student outreach, where project leaders reach out and inform the student body about resources they can benefit from. The STF holds <a href='http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.30'>Open Meetings</a> every week during the academic year to hear, deliberate and vote on campus projects. We encourage students to attend.
